# Everyday Drinks

Date: 2020-10-22

> Tyrion Lannister: That's what I do. I drink and I know things.

I drink a lot, by a lot I mean a LOT of drinks during the day.

Usually it's lots of water during the day; hot, cold, sparkling, mineral water or distilled one, you name it. I can drink more than 2 liters of water, not counting other liquids below,

- Espresso in the morning [[1]], coffee beans from Marks & Spencer it's current favorites

* Pour over coffee with my V60 setup, it usually starts from 12pm;

- Homemade brown sugar lemonade with San Pellegrino sparkling water;

* Glass or two of red wine at the dinner [[2]];

* Some hot tea for my creative time, which starts from 9pm [[3]]

Since I'm in Singapore, I have developed a taste for kopi drinks.

[[1]] I found that it would be quite easier to take a nap after an espresso drink than more contained coffee drinks.

[[2]] Previously I drank wine during lunch time but that affects my whole day, so I tend not to unless there's a special occasion.

[[3]] Turns out in Singapore, for me it's quite troublesome to drink hot drinks in never ending summer, still not used to it. But for night time is quite okay, you get some midnight breeze.
