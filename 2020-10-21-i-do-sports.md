# I do sports

Date: 2020-10-21

Here's the thing, I don't really like sports but if I list out things I did, and for quite some time turns out I do have some persistence.

List of sports I've done or I do currently,

- Athlete at school. It was quite hard not to be an athlete in sports school.

* Mountaineering in university. Most precious moments and friends for life. I'm still doing some hiking in South Asia, currently exploring mountain countries around Singapore, but it's mostly trail runs.

- Cycling in Shenzhen. My first thoughts, after I completed a half day ride, that I felt the loneliest of my life and I found that I will never spend that much time on a bike ever again in a single ride. And I'm not even talking about ass damage.

- Climbing in Hong Kong, acquired a Level 1 Climbing Certificate. Lovely community, my motto was if you cannot go from island you have to climb up.

- At the moment I do enjoy Brazilian Jiu Jitsu in Singapore. I'm [blue belt](https://www.instagram.com/p/BpwF5Mmn3do/) under Renzo Gracie at Evolve.

I still don't really like sports, but I persist.
